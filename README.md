# CoinToss.py

**Coin Toss Game Description**

This Python script implements a simple coin toss game where the user is prompted to guess the outcome of a virtual coin toss. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the outcome.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Input**: The script repeatedly asks the user to enter either 'heads' or 'tails' until a valid guess is made.
2. **Random Coin Toss**: A random number (0 for tails, 1 for heads) is generated using the `random.randint()` function to simulate the coin toss.
3. **Guess Validation**: The user's guess is compared to the result of the coin toss. If the guess is correct, a success message is printed. If the guess is incorrect, a failure message is printed, and the user is asked to guess again.
4. **Game Continuation**: The game continues until the user correctly guesses the outcome of the coin toss.

**Example Use Case:**

1. The user runs the script
